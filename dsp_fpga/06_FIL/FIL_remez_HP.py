# Minimum working example for remez (equiripple) filter designs:
# - low pass (LP) design works as expected, yielding ~ 0.1 dB pass band ripple
#        and 0 dB stop band attenuation 
# - high pass filter design is very strange, yielding ~ 15 db pass band ripple 
#      and 6 dB stop band attenuation?!
#
# Solution: HP needs odd order !!
